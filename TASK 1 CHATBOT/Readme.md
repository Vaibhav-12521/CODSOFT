## üõ†Ô∏è Installation & Setup

Follow these steps to set up and run TyZe on your local machine.

### Prerequisites

* [Python 3.7+](https://www.python.org/downloads/)

* An active internet connection (for downloading dependencies and for web-based features).

### Step-by-Step Guide

1.  **Clone the Repository**
    ```sh
    git clone [https://github.com/your-username/your-repository-name.git](https://github.com/your-username/your-repository-name.git)
    cd your-repository-name
    ```

2.  **Create a Virtual Environment (Recommended)**
    ```sh
    # For Windows
    python -m venv venv
    .\venv\Scripts\activate

    # For macOS/Linux
    python3 -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate
    ```

3.  **Install Dependencies**
    Create a file named `requirements.txt` in the project directory and paste the following lines into it:
    ```txt
    nltk
    AppOpener
    pywhatkit
    beautifulsoup4
    requests
    keyboard
    ```
    Now, run the following command in your terminal to install all the required packages:
    ```sh
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
    The script will automatically download the necessary `punkt` tokenizer from NLTK on its first run.

## üöÄ How to Run

1.  Open your terminal or command prompt.
2.  Navigate to the project directory.
3.  Run the script using the following command:
    ```sh
    python your_script_name.py
    ```
    *(Replace `your_script_name.py` with the actual name of your Python file.)*

4.  The assistant will first ask for your name to personalize the experience. After that, you can start giving it commands!

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notes

* **Administrator Privileges:** The `keyboard` library, used for system volume control, may require you to run the script with administrator or root privileges to function correctly.
    * On Windows, you can do this by opening your Command Prompt or PowerShell as an Administrator.
    * On macOS/Linux, you may need to run the script with `sudo`.
* **Application Control:** The success of opening and closing applications depends on the `AppOpener` library and can vary based on your operating system and how applications are installed.
