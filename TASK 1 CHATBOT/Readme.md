### ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notes

* **Administrator Privileges:** The `keyboard` library, used for system volume control, may require you to run the script with administrator or root privileges to function correctly.
    * On Windows, you can do this by opening your Command Prompt or PowerShell as an Administrator.
    * On macOS/Linux, you may need to run the script with `sudo`.
* **Application Control:** The success of opening and closing applications depends on the `AppOpener` library and can vary based on your operating system and how applications are installed.
